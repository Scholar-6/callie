module.exports = `Hi there! I'm Callie the Calendar Corgi, a slack bot for keeping track of fun events, deadlines, and goals for you and your team. I'm also a very good dog!

Get started and create your first countdown by saying \`@callie start date: <YYYY-MM-DD>, event: <event name>\`, and ask me about countdowns you create by saying \`@callie countdown: <event name>\`.

*Keep in mind that you don't actually need to type the "<" and ">" symbols. That's just how I let you know that those are your own inputs!*

Ask for help if you need it, otherwise, I'll be hangin' around, just doing, you know, impawtent dog stuff.`
