module.exports = `No, no no...like it says in the help and welcome messages, there is no need for an actual \`<\` or \`>\`.

That's just how I tell you to use your own inputs there. So when the example is \`@callie start date: <your date>, event: <your event>\`, do something like this:

"@callie start date: 2040-05-11, event: flight to mars".

Don't do something like this:

@callie start date: <2040-05-11>, event: <flight to mars>.

Why tell you this instead of just scrubbing the offending brackets? Because then you'd ask for countdowns to <flight to mars> and there wouldn't be anything there. This is easier. Trust me.`
